Predict Drug Resistance Before It Happens

Sub Header
HelixMind turns microbial genomes into real-time, predictive intelligence — helping researchers and labs stay ahead of antimicrobial resistance.

Insights 
Antimicrobial resistance costs the global economy $300B–$1T every year — and growing.

Metrics / Proof Points
	•	AMR causes ~1.2M direct deaths annually
	•	Costs healthcare systems $300B+ every year
	•	By 2050, AMR could cost the world $1–3T annually
	•	Genomic ML models have demonstrated >90% predictive accuracy in peer-reviewed studies

HelixMind enables earlier decisions, smarter experiments, and better outcomes.
