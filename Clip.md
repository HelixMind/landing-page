Our Operating Principles

1. Fix Requirements
We start by defining the problem clearly. No assumptions, no vague goals—only well-understood constraints and objectives before action.

2. Delete Unnecessary Work
If something doesn’t meaningfully improve outcomes, it’s removed. We value focus over motion and eliminate distractions that dilute signal.

3. Simplify What Remains
Complexity is reduced wherever possible. Clear systems, clear thinking, and repeatable frameworks take priority over cleverness.

4. Accelerate Cycle Time
We shorten feedback loops to learn faster. Decisions are tested, reviewed, and refined quickly to avoid stagnation.

5. Automate
Once a process is proven, we automate it. This frees attention for higher-leverage thinking and continuous improvement.
